                        The Directorate General of Shipping is an attached office of the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, Govt. of India and deals with all executive matters, relating to merchant shipping. Indian shipping remained a deferred subject till independence. It was only thereafter, the development of shipping attracted the state policy. The subject of Shipping was, in the beginning, dealt with by the Ministry of Commerce, till 1949 and subsequently, in 1951, it was shifted to the Ministry of Transport and Shipping. In 1947, the Government of India announced the National Policy on Shipping, aiming at the total development of the industry. In order to accelerate the developmental efforts, the necessity for a centralized Administrative organization was felt and accordingly, it was in September 1949, the Directorate General of Shipping with its Headquarters at Bombay was established.
